        <h2>What is Burnout?</h2>
        <p>
          Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion
          caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It occurs when you feel
          overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands.
          It's more than just feeling tired; it's a sense of depletion and a
          loss of motivation that can affect your health and outlook on life.

        <h2>Recovery and Prevention Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          Recovering from burnout requires a conscious effort to rest, reset,
          and re-evaluate. Here are some steps you can take:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Prioritize Rest:</strong> Ensure you are getting enough
            quality sleep and taking regular breaks throughout your day.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Set Boundaries:</strong> Learn to say "no" to new tasks or
            commitments when your plate is already full. Protect your time and
            energy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Disconnect:</strong> Schedule time away from screens, email,
            and work-related thoughts. Allow your mind to truly relax.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reconnect with Hobbies:</strong> Make time for activities
            that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of your responsibilities.
